**THPIA** is the latest augmentation algorithm for simulating the breeding process of three-line hybrid rice.Â  It is a heuristic algorithm for dealing with class imbalance problems. It can effectively synthesize minority instances in the data set while ensuring the quality of minority instances.

If you want to use it, it can be found in the file "three_series." Before use, you can adjust the synthetic composition of minority instances by setting hyperparameters. 

Of course, we very much hope that you can cite our article after using it. As follows:
